Client-error
These codes indicate that an issue occured on the client side that prevents
the server from fulfilling the request.
400- Bad request
signifies that the server couldn't understand the request due to invalid syntax
or missing information.

401-Unauthorized 
client doesn't hav the necesarry authorization to access the requested resource.
often happens when a resource is protected by a passworrd /requires login.
for solution client may repeat the request with a suitable authorization header 
field.

402- Payment required
code is reserved for future use.

403- Forbidden:
Client is authorized but doesn't have permission to access the specific resource.
due to access control lists or other restrictions on the server side.
Server understood the request but is refusing to fulfill it.

404-Not found -requested resource could not be found on the server. "page not found"
but might exist somewhere.
405- Method not allowed - http method used in the request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)	
is not allowed for the specified resource.eg trying to DELETE a resource that only 
allows you to GET will result to the above error.
 The response MUST include an Allow header containing a list of valid methods for 
the requested resource.

406- Not acceptable - server can't generate a response that meets the client's
preference specified in the request headers(like prefered language or content type)

407 - Proxy authentication required
similar to 401, but for situations where a proxy server requires authentication b4 
accessing the requested resource.

408- Request timeout: client took too long to complete the request, and the server
timed out waiting for a response.

410 Gone - requested resource is no longer available and wont be available again.
412 Precondition Failed: A precondition specified in the client's request headers (like an expectation for a specific file modification time) wasn't met by the server.

413 Payload Too Large: The request payload (data sent by the client) is larger than the server is willing to accept. This often happens with file uploads that exceed size limits.

414 URI Too Long: The URL (Uniform Resource Identifier) used in the request is too long. Some servers have limitations on the maximum URL length they can handle.

415 Unsupported Media Type: The server doesn't support the media type (like image format) of the data included in the request.

416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable: This occurs in scenarios where the client requests a specific range of data from a resource, but the server can't fulfill that request (e.g., requesting a byte range that goes beyond the end of the file).

417 Expectation Failed: This is a less common code that indicates the server couldn't meet an expectation specified by the client in the "Expect" header field.

It's important for developers and web administrators to understand these client-side error codes to diagnose and resolve issues that prevent users from successfully accessing resources. By providing informative error messages that correspond to the specific error code, users can get a better idea of what went wrong and how to potentially fix it.
